It involves practices aimed at reducing waste generation, reusing materials, and recycling. Minimizing waste starts with mindful consumption, choosing products with minimal packaging and opting for reusable items over disposable ones. Extending the life of products by finding new uses for them, such as using reusable bags, containers, and bottles, can significantly cut down on waste. Properly sorting recyclables like paper, plastic, glass, and metals ensures they are processed into new products, conserving resources and reducing landfill use. Composting organic waste, such as food scraps and yard waste, transforms it into valuable compost that enriches soil and reduces methane emissions from landfills. Hazardous waste, including chemicals, batteries, and electronics, requires special handling and should be disposed of safely through community hazardous waste collection events.",
